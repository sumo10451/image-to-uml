As a Senior Solution Architect, analyze the provided section of the architecture diagram to support the threat modeling of the system. Please perform the following for this specific section:

1. **Identify All Objects and Connections:**
   - List every object (e.g., services, databases, components) visible in this section.
   - For each object, note any metadata or attributes associated with it.

2. **Detail Every Connection:**
   - For each connection in this section, specify:
     - The source and destination objects.
     - The directionality of the connection:
       - Unidirectional: `-->` or `<--`
       - Bidirectional: `<-->`
     - Any relevant metadata, protocols, or technologies used (e.g., `uses HTTPS/TLS1.2`).
   - Mention if objects have multiple connections.

3. **Categorize Objects by Boundaries:**
   - Identify any boundaries present in this section (e.g., `Azure Cloud`, `On-Premise`, `Trusted`, `Semi-Trusted`, `Untrusted`).
   - Categorize each object according to its boundary.
   - Group the connections based on the boundaries of the objects they connect.

4. **List Leftover Connections:**
   - Identify any connections not previously mentioned within this section.
   - Ensure no connections are omitted from your description.

5. **Provide a Structured Explanation:**
   - Present the information clearly and professionally, suitable for discussion with a Security Architect.
   - Use the following format for consistency:

**Format:**

- **Objects and Boundaries:**
  - *Boundary Name*:
    - *Trust Level*:
      - Object 1
      - Object 2
      - ...

- **Connections:**
  1. *Connection Number*: `Source Object Direction Destination Object` uses `Protocol/Metadata`
     - Example: `1. Azure Cosmos DB --> Kubernetes Cluster uses HTTPS/TLS1.2`

- **Leftover Connections:**
  - List any additional connections here.

6. **Important Instructions:**
   - Do not include introductory or concluding phrases; start directly with the explanation.
   - Do not infer or assume information not explicitly shown in this section of the diagram.
   - Only describe elements and connections that are directly visible.
