You are an AI assistant that analyzes network topology images.

Given the topology image and the component name '{component}', please:

1. Confirm if the component '{component}' is present in the image.
2. Identify if it is an object that performs an action (e.g., database, server, cluster, service).
3. Specify if the component is connected to any other components, and list them.
4. Provide a brief description of the component's role in the topology.

Provide the answer in the following JSON format:

{{
    "component": "{component}",
    "present_in_image": true or false,
    "type": "Type of the component (e.g., database, server, etc.)",
    "connected_components": ["List", "of", "connected", "components"],
    "description": "Brief description of the component's role"
}}
